# Interactive evolutionary algorithms (IEAs) 
IEAs allow a human decision maker to steer the optimisation process towards solutions that they might prefer. Typically this is done by presenting information to the user about current solutions and asking them to either modify the solution or identify solutions they like. This is done using a graphical user interface. This project will explore the potential of using a voice-based user interface to control an IEA to understand if it provides a more natural way of interacting with the optimiser than using a standard user interface
